<div class="About-Me">
    <h1>Hello, I'm Anthony</h1>
        <p class="lead">I am a Software Developer currently located in Atlanta, GA. I attended Clemson University and graduated with a B.S. in Economics along with Legal Studies and Philosophy minors.
            Upon graduation I went into the Financial Services field. I started as a financial service representative at E*TRADE Financial. After a few years of moving up the ladder in the Financial 
            world and seeing the many different sides. I realized this career path wasnt for me, I just didnt have a passion for it and I didnt want to just do it because I was good. I wanted to find something 
            that I enjoyed doing and could call a passion and put all I had into it. This is where coding came into the picture, I have always loved technology and have been mystified at the amazing things we
            have been able to fo with programming and decided to actually give it a go.
            <br><br>
            It didnt take long for me to realize coding and software development was what I had been looking for all this time. Quickly I was finding myself staying up until the early hours of the morning
            just practicing and working out problems. I knew this was my perfect fit, not only was the topic super interesting to me but the type of work was exactly what I needed. I love problem solving, and 
            when it comes down to it, that is what software development is. I am currently enrolled in DigitalCrafts' four-month, full-stack immersive coding bootcamp to take my skills to the next level.
